# Arachne 2.0

## Description

Arachne 2.0 is an advanced robotic surveillance platform designed for smooth movement using sine wave values. This project implements servo control to maneuver a quadruple-arm bot effectively in various environments. It features an interface to control the bot's movement through serial input.

## Features

- **Smooth Movement:** Utilizes sine wave values for realistic and fluid motion.
- **Multiple Servo Control:** Capable of controlling multiple servos simultaneously.
- **Serial Communication:** Allows user input via a serial interface to control the bot's movements.

## Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Adafruit PWM Servo Driver
- Servos (compatible with PWM control)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply for servos
